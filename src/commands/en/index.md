# Documentation for [MCGalaxy](https://github.com/ClassiCube/MCGalaxy) commands

This website hosts command documentation of the commonly used server software on ClassiCube.

Throughout documentation, `<angled brackets>` and `[square brackets]` are used for annotating command usage. This annotation helps describe a command’s argument and if that argument is optional or not. `<Angled brackets>` describe an optional argument, while `[square brackets]` are required arguments. For example, `/Cuboid <block>` states that the `<block>` argument is optional and could be replaced with an appropriate value such as `cobblestone`.
